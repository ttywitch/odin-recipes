            </li>
            <li>
                Line the air fryer basket with aluminum foil. 
                Add bacon slices in a single layer and cook until crispy, 
                about 8 minutes. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from the air fryer and set aside on a 
                paper towel-lined plate. Reduce temperature to 325 degrees F 
                (165 degrees C). Spray 2 large ramekins or heatproof 
                bowls with cooking spray, and press one tortilla

                Crack 2 eggs into each tortilla shell, 
                then top each with 1/4 cup cheese.

                1/8 teaspoon salt.

            <li>
                Working with one tortilla bowl at a time, 
                cook in the air fryer until tortillas are crispy, 
                egg whites are set, and yolks are runny, 13 to 15 minutes. 
            </li>
            <li>
                While tortillas cook, stir together cherry tomatoes, 
                cilantro, scallions, lime juice, remaining 
                1/2 teaspoon adobo seasoning, and remaining 
                1/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. 
                Break bacon into small pieces, and set aside. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove tortillas from bowls and place on a plate. 
                Top bowls evenly with tomato mixture, avocado, and bacon.
