        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            These delicious breakfast cakes are said 
            to resemble those from a famous pancake house. 
            When replacing milk for buttermilk, 
            increase lemon juice to 1 1/2 tablespoons. 
            Serve topped with butter.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ¼ cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 dash salt</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter, or as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
            <li>Mix buttermilk, vegetable oil, and vanilla in a bowl; 
                stir in sugar. Whisk in flour, baking powder, 
                baking soda, and salt, combining the batter with 
                just a few strokes to moisten. Leave the lumps. 
            </li>
            <li>Whisk egg and lemon juice together in a separate bowl; 
                gently stir into the batter. Refrigerate the batter 
                for at least 30 minutes, up to 1 hour. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a large skillet over medium heat and grease with the butter. 
                Pour 1/3 cup of batter per pancake into the skillet 
                and cook until bubbles appear on the surface, about 2 minutes. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Flip with spatula and brown the other side, about 2 more minutes. 
            </li>
